# Welcome to my new blog

Blogs are made up of Postsâ€¦ and Jekyll has the concept built in to its default structure. Markdown stubs created in the _posts folder will flesh out your content and can be accessed in layouts by date, tag, and category.

## Each post must be given a filename following the pattern:

yyyy-mm-dd-title.md
